        <p>
                Nowadays, most current NBA Stats websites only show the statistics about players or teamsin a highly integrated level, and from very limited perspectives such aspointes/rebounds pergame, yet we know there are much more data we could play, and much more interestingpatterns we could discover. Recently we came across a datasetNBA Play-By-Play Stats2017-18. It includes all events that occur in a game including: active lineups, shot distances,shot locations in X, Y coordinates, assists, time remaining, and tons of other interesting datapoints in the past season. It seems that, using these data, we could nearly bring the pastgames back to alive!
